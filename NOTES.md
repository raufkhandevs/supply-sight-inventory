# SupplySight Dashboard - Development Notes

## 🎯 **Project Overview**

Professional Daily Inventory Dashboard for SupplySight with React + Tailwind CSS and Apollo GraphQL. Features real-time inventory management, demand updates, and stock transfers.

## 🏗️ **Architecture**

- **React 19** + React Router v7 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- **Apollo Client v4** for GraphQL with custom hooks
- **shadcn/ui** components with atomic design principles

## 🔧 **Key Features**

- **Dashboard**: KPI cards, trend chart, filters, paginated table
- **Interactive**: Product drawer, demand updates, stock transfers
- **UX**: Smooth animations, loading states, toast notifications
- **Business Logic**: Status calculation (Healthy/Low/Critical), fill rate

## 📊 **Business Logic**

```typescript
// Status: Healthy (stock > demand), Low (stock = demand), Critical (stock < demand)
// Fill Rate: (sum(min(stock, demand)) / sum(demand)) * 100%
```

## 🎯 **Trade-offs**

- Apollo Client caching over manual state management
- Core functionality over edge cases
- Professional design with usability balance

## 🔮 **Future Improvements**

- Enhanced error handling and validation

- Real-time updates and advanced analytics
- User management and audit trails
- Mobile app and AI integration

## 🧪 **Testing**

- TypeScript compilation ensures type safety
- Manual testing for UI interactions
- Recommended: Unit, integration, and E2E tests
